# Apollo Engineering Challenge

This software seeks to provide CRUD-style API access to
data stored in a database system. We use SQLite, a simple DBMS, and Flask to provide the API services. 

```create_db.py``` initializes a database file.

```api.py``` implements API access with the desired GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods.

```test_api.py``` is a simple test suite of the API functions.
